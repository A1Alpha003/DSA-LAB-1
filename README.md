Percentage 	Grade 
0 – 60	F
61 – 70	D
71 – 80	C
81 – 90	B
91 – 100	A


Write a program that accepts a numeric grade and displays the corresponding letter grade. 


Last digit 	Modifier 
1 – 3 	-
4 – 7	<blank>
8 – 0	+


Modify the previous program to print out a + or - after the letter grade based on the last digit of the score. The modifiers are listed in the table on the right. 
For example, 81=B-, 94=A, and 68=D+. Note that an F is only an F; there is no F+ or F-.
